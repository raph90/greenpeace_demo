### Assignment brief: Build a website for a charity.

PLEASE SEE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE FOR REFERENCES AND ACCREDITATIONS

## Project intentions: 

1) To build a 5-page website that uses all contemporary and historical layout patterns. These are:
    a) Floats and clearfixes
    b) CSS Flexbox
    c) CSS Grid

2) Charity of choice: Greenpeace

3) To have a consistent and responsive page layout: 
    a) A functional header and nav that resizes on smaller screens. The nav will stay the same across pages.
    b) a main content section
    c) a footer that remains fixed at the bottom of the page

4) To have 5 pages (and corresponding design styles): 
    
    i) Home (Floats and clearfixes)
    ii) About (Flexbox)
    iii) Activity (Flexbox)
    iv) Community (Grid)
    v) Contact / Get Involved (Grid)

5) The specification asked for an image gallery, and though I have opted against having a 'gallery' section, I have used images throughout, and in particular on the 
activity and community pages. I hope this is sufficient. 

Notes:
- I was originally intending for the about page to use a tabular structure, but pretty much everything on the internet told me not to do this. 
- I've added a table as the footer and on the contact page to show that I know how to use them, but opted for flexbox/grid for the overall structure.
- I have included a small script to switch my videos in and out. I hope this is ok. 
- The website is fully responsive across devices. 
- Generally I've used div backgrounds for images rather than inline img tags, simply as a matter of preference
- The about page is a selection of videos, to demonstrate that I know how to use them and integrate them into the website
- Generally speaking, I haven't paid a great deal of attention to the semantic content of the website - whether it's consistent with good marketing etc. I've approached this task as a showcase of what I can do as a developer.
